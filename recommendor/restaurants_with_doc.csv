At which point I had to leave as I had plans for later on that evening. Not sure as to why I was able to make the booking in the first place if they are just going to turn people away!  "

City is perfect for all of your social and corporate events with a plethora of dining rooms, AV and conference facilities.The decor was horrendous, with dirty surfaces damaged chairs , dirty toilets it’s had a feel of complete neglect even down to the paint on the wall all marked and dirty. This was far from luxury and as for the food it was tasteless- I asked for my stake to be medium rare it came blue. The whole atmosphere was unsettling and I felt robbed after paying the bill. I though this chain of restaurant was know for its high standards but in all honesty It had lower standards than miller and carter. I will never step foot in a Gauchos again.                     Great menu and staff were very helpful. Would go back to this location.                  Lovely experience, waiters were very helpful and accommodating to our dietary requirements. The atmosphere was beautiful and the food was 10/10. Highly recommended.                           Services was brilliant , recommend steak was delicious , sides were disappointing… all very expensive.                     In fact was a very nice night! I was so happy when I came down I asked to the man that was at reception I told to him we have a reservation asked my name and he told me with Spanish accent ( Colombia or VENEZUELA) I’m from VENEZUELA and I was so happy to listen my name wuaooooo perfecto in Spanish was so cool! Then he show our table, then our waitresses was Aitor! He was fabulous, gave the recommendation with the empanadas (chicken he prefer but we got chicken, meat and potatoes so delicious very fresh!

But… Did the bottomless brunch deal and the drinks were hit and miss - espresso martini was insanely strong almost undrinkable. Food was ok - fritters were missing the jam and not enough avocado, shakshuka was underwhelming and the desserts were stodgy, dry and bland which was a shame.. don’t think I’d go back as there are much better bottomless brunch deals to be had. Felt very much under the allotted time pressure of 1.5 hours - waitress kept mentioning it - which was also a bit irritating. Stunning place though and lovely saxophonist adding to the atmosphere..                     This place is amazing not only was it dog friendly, but even if you didn't have a dog this restaurant would be an ideal place to celebrate a special occasion or simply enjoy lovely food with a loved one or your family. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The food was excellent and very well presented. Highly recommended!                     This restaurant is great. I have visited their Victoria restaurant before, but the Threadneedle Street one is just as good, if not a tad better. The service was excellent, everyone we spoke to was extremely attentive and helpful. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the burrata, the rump steak (which was the most flavoursome rump I've had) and snickers for dessert. All were delicious.                      From the moment we walked in the service was just amazing. The staff are knowledgeable, attentive and very good at what they do. The food was unbelievable ....we tried the steak roulette...what a great idea - you spin it at your table. Our waiter was amazing, really helped to add the experience....the whole evening was superb. Great food, great service and fantastic wine......you can't beat that.                 Been here a number of times when in London, always a great meal with excellent service. I felt compelled to to write a review this time as the meal was one of the best I have ever had.                          "

Shame the wine list is not as long as it was pre pandemic.           Nice food was totally let down by poor service, such a shame!      Disappointing and depressing. Lacks ambience. Took a loooong time to get a glass of tap water. Had to ask several times. Food ok. Limited wine by the glass. No champagne by the glass. I guess I was expecting something a bit more up-market.              Excellent Sushi restaurant.

And if you're a Burgundy lover it's probably the best list in London.

Staff were all super from start to finish, and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Truly an exceptionally pleasant evening.              Fabulous food and wine, great service and ambiance.

I would recommend ElVino to friends. The booze is good, the food is fine and the ambience was very good as it was near Christmas. However the service was inattentive as it took us ages to get served despite only a few diners being in. Worst of all by far was the fact that our booking wasn’t in the booking book, due to Open Table not updating the restaurant. This is totally unacceptable. So would I recommend El Vino, yes. Would I ever use Open Table again, absolutely not unless something changes and I will let others know to do the same.         Really good vegetarian mezze. Really good lunchtime getaway with the team. We could hear each other. Service was quick. An overall great experience.      Modern stylish wine bar with a good and varied range of wines at honest prices, food portion size could be bigger but quality good.  "

The atmosphere and ambience were lively and lively. It got busy as the night progressed and as a result the service suffered with us having to call a waiter or waitress everything we wanted something. The cocktails were well worth it but the starters and mains were underwhelming for their cost. Not the best value for money but a lovely night nonetheless       Food was underwhelming, not what I would of expected. Wine was ridiculously expensive for what is was, but they did make a good cocktail. Wouldn’t go back.      We waited half an hour to be seated to our pre-booked meal which is crazy! Rib-eye was unreal Seabass was massive - be careful of the bones Mac’n’Cheese was delicious Chips were crunchy Sticky toffee pudding was yummy and sweet Blushing lady cocktail was delicious     Overall,this was a very disappointing meal. We chose this restaurant as it was close to our theatre and we had happily dined at the New Change location previously. The evening started well when the host moved us from our original table due to the a/c being quite fierce, good customer service. The wait staff throughout were very attentive. However we chose Gordon’s special, the Beef Wellington, accepting the cook time of 45 minutes, as we had plenty of time and that’s where the dinner went wrong. Firstly, we asked for it to be medium but the waiter insisted that it be medium rare, as that’s how Gordon likes it to be served. Eventually we compromised as the waiter promised that it would be pink in the middle but not rare and that my wife could have the outer edges, which would be more medium and I’d have the m/r centre. When the dish came the first observation was that it smelled very heavily of garlic and we do not really like a lot of garlic in our food. When we tasted it, the garlic was overwhelming, to the obliteration of the taste of the beef. Secondly, far from being medium rare, the centre was rare to the extent that it was chewy and unpalatable. We have eaten Beef Wellington many times in many different restaurants over the years and this was by far the worst, not least because it was one of the dearest at £96! We would not normally comment and were prepared to pay and leave but we were asked by the waitress how the meal was and told her of our disappointment;she called over a manager and we expressed our issues to him and confirmed that we were still happy to pay. However, he initially offered us two glasses of champagne, which we declined as we were ready to leave to get to our show and in any event I was driving, and then he insisted on adjusting the bill. Although we didn’t want the adjustment, when it came it was rather derisory, representing just a coke and a single scoop ice cream. I don’t think we shall be returning, which is always the test for us. "

Good food, noisy atmosphere, service was slow but didn't bother us too much     Not as good as I’d hoped. Definitely good quality food and generous portions, but the mains were not as special as the starters. Naan was burnt. Dessert disappointing.  Atmosphere impersonal.   I’d go again if in the area though   Overall, a nice experience. Myself and my partner had a 4 course vegan menu for £30. All of the food was tasty, although not for those who can't tolerate a lot of spice. We did wait quite a while to have our orders taken and for our first course to come but was efficient after that.

Despite offering a solely vegan menu, alter is not just for vegans, it’s for everyone, an inclusive eating and drinking space that transports guests with upbeat dishes that focus on what is gained, not lost by being part of this global movement.  Andy says: ‘I couldn’t be more excited to bring Alter to East London. This is the big one. It’s the fullest realisation yet of the Alter I saw in my head when I first started. A place where everyone can have everything on the menu, vegan or not. It’s never been about preaching to people. I just want everyone to feel excited to discover new things in a setting that feels part Thai backstreet noodle joint, part inner city Tokyo dive bar.’Dishes full of flavour and texture, and team very helpful on the dishes we were unfamiliar with, giving great recommendations.       When looking at the menu, I wasn't sure what to expect from the food; I didn't know what most of the food would look like, let alone taste like. ALTER absolutely blew me away with every single dish we had. The taste were incredible. The portion sizes were perfect. The service was excellent. Completely blown away and will highly recommend to friends.        OUTSTANDING. Everyone needs to come here whether you’re vegan or not. Both my brother and I are flexitarian (though I mainly eat vegan meals) and were blown away by the flavours. The pizza ajo blanco was particularly exceptional and so clever. The flavours burst in your mouth! We also really enjoyed the laksa. The only slightly negative comment I have is that the tofu dish is described as having a ‘sauce’. I think this is somewhat misleading. Imagine chunks of tofu swimming in a warmly spiced flavoursome watery broth and that’s what this dish is. Definitely not what we expected but still nice. We even mixed the tofu with the laksa towards the end which turned out to be a delicious combo. The mango sticky rice dessert is sensational. That and the pizza were definitely the two dishes that were most unique in terms of flavour. My brother and I intend to come back and will be raving about it to anyone and everyone!                  Fantastic all vegan food & cocktails. Full of delicious flavour combinations and lovely to know everything on the menu is safe for vegans to eat. So good I got a takeaway for next day too!

They skimped on the fries and provided about a teaspoon of ketchup. The shot glass provided for “unlimited refills” for almost 4 pounds was a joke.

The only food option was sandwiches!! Hence we left and had a lovely meal elsewhere.    The only thing good about our meal was the pudding! I am especially disappointed as I was taking 2 friends out as a belated anniversary meal. We arrived a little later than our 7pm slot as the place was so difficult to find. We thought we had actually walked into a club the music was so loud - could hardly hear yourself think and none of us are exactly oldies!! It's not clearly indicated where the restaurant is so spent another 5 mins wandering around the ground and lower floor looking for it then asked someone behind the bar, really loudly ....twice (due to the volume of the music!) we were grunted at and they pointed to a lift. We went upstairs and oh my god the music was even louder!! We were shown to the table and given the menu and told that they had run out of the Steak and Beef Rib options which left Vegetarian , Chicken Schnitzel or Hake - none of which we particularly liked! How on earth can a restaurant run out of these dishes by 7pm in the evening is beyond me. Considering tables are pre-booked, one would think they would have some idea and order their stock accordingly! We ordered the Hake which was ok but the samphire that accompanied it was awful...full of stalks and chewy, in other words, cheap and nasty which just about summed up this place. Would never go there again and would never recommend. I even spoke to the manager and complained and was met with complete indifference - not bothered in the slightest! No wonder they are putting on these deals so cheaply, as the saying goes, if it seems to good to be true then it probably is! Avoid, avoid, avoid!            My boyfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful meal here together for Valentine’s Day. Amazing food on the set menu, a great variety also impeccably presented. Service could not of been better, thank you Anker! Will definitely visit again great value and lovely setting for dinner. "

Lovely decor and quiet for a weekday      My friend ordered a grilled salmon salad but a waitress took the order wrong and gave him a vegetarian salad instead. That's fine because it might be due to miscommunication in the noisy environment. What annoyed me most was the attitude of the waitress - she was inpatient and keep on blaming my friend for ordering the wrong food (while I don't think it's anyone's fault - it's just miscommunication). Food was not too bad but service can be improved. Probably won't go again as I picked this restaurant but was quite embarrassed at the end as my friend was treated impolitely.         Much nicer than you might expect and a pleasant envionment and attentive service.

Nose to tail eating means that, where appropriate, every part of the animal should be put to good use in the kitchen and so along with Roast Beef and Lemon Sole, diners will find Rolled Pig’s Spleen, Kidneys and Ox Heart, Liver and Chitterlings as well as the Roast Bone Marrow & Parsley Salad, something of a ‘signature’ dish.Half of the menu was out of stock despite it being lunchtime and not some weird time of day. When i ordered a dish that was described as a mix of cheese, potato and spring onion i was brought a plate that literally just had a block of microwaved cheese, 3 whole boiled potatoes to its side, and a bunch of green onions. If i wanted this kind of ""dish"" i would have just went to a supermarket. My mother's ""salad"" had more bread than actual salad, and my dad's ""potted pork"" looked more like a blob of yesterday's tuna from the fridge.                  Bones on toast half the side it used to be. We’ve been eating with you for over the last 12 years and getting smaller each time but this was a huge difference. Fully understand cos of ingredients at present, happy to pay more or just be informed before we order.         Incredible food, amazing staff. Took our 6 month old noisy baby who had the time of her life thanks to the kind staff.Drinks were brilliant too.

The setting is opulent and service good but if a premium steak house can’t cook a rare sirloin steak correctly first time then it’s not worth a visit.       Wonderful!

Overall feeling of disappointment. My girlfriend had seafood risotto which was amazing. I ordered bruschetta and spaghetti vongole. Both came as quite a small portions but the problem for me was the vongole. It had lots of vegetables mixed in with it. This took away from the dish as they made it watery and it lost all it's flavour.  I left still hungry. Not exactly value for money, in my opinion.            Calamari starter, wild boar tagliatelle & vegan pizza were all excellent. Basket of home made bread was overpriced at£3.50 for 6 slices. Friendly staff. Female loo was out of order so had to use male toilets not a problem but there is no lock on the toilet door and there is a male urinal outside by the sink so not ideal but I’ve travelled in Europe where it’s quite common so I wasn’t too bothered and the restaurant wasn’t busy as it was early evening.

Both the food and service were of a very high quality. Yes, it’s somewhat expensive, but I was ok given the amount (generous portion sizes) of fresh food served. A very sociable event too, which added to the enjoyment. Will be back again!         Lovely Japanese bbq. Friendly service and fantastic food.        Food was good. Service was a little haphazard. One of our items ordered was forgotten. There was too long a pause between certain items on the main course. 1 waiter who was not as warm as the others.       A few items was not available which was disappointing as we went there for it. The meats are way too salty to a point where some parts are bitter after being grilled. Staff forgot one rice dish which was annoying as half way through we realised it wasn't coming out we had to reorder as it was for my children. Overall we won't be coming back especially not to this branch.    A great place to hang out with friends and sample Japanese style dining.  "

With its professional, friendly service and warm ambience, the Bistro offers both traditional and modern French fare ranging from classic Omelettes, Coq au Vin and Steak Frites to Breast of Duck and Shank of Lamb, plus a great-value list of 450 wines by the bottle and a dozen by the glass. Our popular terrace at our charming french Bistro situated in Bleeding Heart Yard is open from Spring to Autumn months and accommodates more than 30 people. Diners can enjoy traditional French dishes ranging from Lapin à la moutarde and Navarin of Organic Lamb.BHB never disappoints: and arguably the food is now even better than ever. Absolutely classic cuisine; all the best of France and more. Fabulous     Authentic and romantic French bistro.  Delicious food and excellent service.             Fantastic accommodating team, great service - will be back      So good to see Bleeding Heart Yard back in action now covid is so nearly behind us. The food is as ever exemplary, perhaps if it can be even a tad better than before the turmoil, and the ambience and service just right. Thank you, Bleeding Hart - back soon.      Excellent food, good wine list, overall good service and a nice atmosphere.   They fell down on one point: when our mains arrived we were missing the side dish we had ordered. When we asked we were told, sorry, two minutes.In fact the side never arrived and when the table was being cleared I mentioned this and got the response, Oh well, you had vegetables with your main - not really the point.   So, we will go back with maybe the feeling that the reputation for service in Paris is being maintained in London!"

First class service and good food- will certainly come back    Service was good, no problem there. The food was very poor, and awful value for money. The duck breast meal was bland, and small, and the Duck was over cooked. The potato rosti starter was borderline burnt and again awful value. The poached egg was nice.  "

I am sure there are many other more restaurants are worth to go than this one. I will never return to this one.               The restaurant was acceptable and service ok but could have been better         The food was good but it felt like we waited hours for it to arrive. They brought the food separately as well and we waited almost 20 mins for the last part of it. The place was not even that busy so it didn’t make sense. People sitting next to us arrive after us and got their food much quicker.  This is also a karaoke place so be prepared to hear drunken loud singing down the corridor whilst you’re eating.  Definitely wouldn’t go back again sorry.                   Always found it difficult to get good Chinese food in London but Kirin did the job. Setting pleasant if not a little quiet. Service good very attentive. Very tasty dishes. Only complaint is it is a bit pricey. May be as it is in an area during the week that caters for rich banker types but cannot fault the food. Wine well priced though to be fair. "

Please note: we currently do not accept OpenTable dining cheques.We booked a 1030pm table on a Tuesday and we’re the only diners so the service was impeccable considering we had the restaurant to ourselves. Steaks were cooked perfectly to order and sides all very good aswell. No vernalise available but assume they didn’t want to be making this so late in the evening which is fair enough. Definitely would come back       Absolutely disgusting service, food took 2 hours to come out and when it did the steak was blue. Took 30 minutes to bring a drink after asking twice and when asked regarding taking the cold horrible food off the bill the security guard grabbed my partner by his collar. Will never return and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone will be reporting all pictures of food to the press.     This particular Guacho branch was not to the standard of the Piccadilly 1. The food was awful, unseasoned and partially cold. Our starter took over 1 hour to come, but the waitress was lovely and very apologetic - She gave us a discount on the bill for the wait. However when the starter did finally come, it was burnt. The cocktails tasted synthetic ( definitely pre-made and not fresh) and when ordering a pint of beer, you’re given 1/2 pint for the same price. Overall, it was shockingly poor and very expensive for what we received. First time I hace been to Gaucho and I was really excited about the dinner yesterday. Unfortunately, the waiters were bit unprofessional and the food was alright but the fries were cooked multiple times and would be good to have fresh fries for that price.    Terrible food and atmosphere, mojito made with Apple juice.Steak chewy, and this at New Year’s Eve.Avoid "

Today's service was way below the usual high standard of service you receive at The Folly. Service was sllooooww. Food was cold and a replacement took 15 mins before it was returned.

Arriving very early for the booking, we were given a table straight away.

Good atmosphere in the restaurant and nicely decorated.    Venue is beautiful. Staff were very friendly, but food wasn’t good at all.

So lovely and will deffo be back to humble grape        Love it, will be going again. Great ambiance, great service - amazing wine!     Lovely food, service and atmosphere - wine expensive, although hAve always been good    Everything fantastic. Only slight blemish was that the Camembert took 30 mins      Easy to find and definitely worth it! It’s an Aladdin’s cave shelved high with beautiful wines and bottles. The wine choices are amazing and the food is definitely worth it. We had the butcher board as a lunchtime meal and it was certainly filling! 10/10 and I would definitely recommend it.  "

There was a particularly noisy group there and the noise level was too high we had to move table. Staff were helpful but the design of the place was the problem. Was expensive but good was good    Whilst the food was good, it was cold and the side dishes came some time after our meal was served. The restaurant was also on the chilli side so we did not have a comfortable night.      The guys here were so friendly. The food was fab too    Staff were very pushy kept coming to the table while we were talking felt like we were being rushed     Unfortunately we were rushed and couldn’t fully enjoy the experience. We will definitely go again so that we can savour the experience a bit more. Would be unfair to review, however, the Wagyu beef burger topped with truffle was really good!

Quiet evening as we were the only people upstairs so ambience not brilliant but….food good and given a drink after by owner to satisfy our drink pangs after food!     Very nice food. Good service, although despite not being more than about 50% full, reasonably slow service, but ok really. A couple of issues with dishes, one turned up when we'd finished, the waitress ensured it was taken off the bill, but a drink which wasn't served stayed on the bill. The guy doing the music probably just needs to dial the volume down a couple. Otherwise, lovely food and good evening. "

We had both been here before so we knew we’d enjoy it. It’s just a nice place for a lunch ; the seating is close and intimate so you can chat even if there’s loads of background noise. Also, the food is really nice, I’ve had from their brunch menu as well as main menu and have not been disappointed. We also stayed a bit later for a coffee and cake.     Food was lovely, however they gave you a bill everytime you ordered rather than paying at the end. They claimed they do pay as you go. But it’s very cheeky they add service to every bill. We ordered our meal payed service charge then ordered chips payed additional service charge ect.. wasn’t fair at all.     Brilliant food tasted so good and got so much the menu was so versatile and had plenty to choose from It was my wife’s birthday and had the birthday pancake stack which was amazing can’t wait to come back               Good ambience, good location next to bus and train stop, food very good many options for breakfast.                Nothing crazy fancy but everything was done well. Service was a little odd; we were asked almost immediately if we knew what we wanted and i get people look ahead but there wasn’t even a chance to look at the drinks before i was asked what food i wanted. The menu is very varied but i did have to ask questions such as what is in the breakfast sandwich other than egg? or can i get a side of hash browns? The service was quick but it was hard to actually hear what the waiter was saying at some points because the room is small and it got loud. Its a solid place to go but there just lots of little things stopping it from getting 5*.  "

Great place     Nice decorated restaurant with friendly service. However the overall rating suffers under der poor price performance. The fish ""on the board"" is sharply overpriced. £30 for a small piece of halibut and £21 for a smaller piece of cod are not justified by the quality or preparation quality. While the the 'normal' fish & chops looked okay the 'fresh' is infatoinary. We won't come again       Excellent food and venue     Staff were fantastic. Friendly and helpful. Food was delicious.

Overall good experience.      Very nice food and customer service was good. Just a couple of small negatives, firstly we all ate our dinner at the same time apart from one member of our party, they ordered pizza which came after we had finished, secondly disappointed they automatically added a 15% service charge onto the bill, I think we should decide if we want to leave a tip and tbh the meal prices were on par with what you would expect to pay so why the large charge?        pretty good food, but not exceptional. friendly service but a fit frantic. very basic downstairs ""cellar"" dining room.            Amazing food at this place so we will always keep going back! Service is good but when there are a few tables it can take a while to get drinks. Overall, a great place to go to have interesting veggie Indian food         Amazing vegan Indian food. Delicious jeera aloo and ‘chicken’ masala. Breads were also lovely. Friendly staff.

Service was friendly and quite attentive, but there were some misunderstandings about our orders (a language problem), and an error at the till nearly caused us to be overcharged. All was corrected however, and this did not detract from a very pleasant overall experience. The restaurant is slightly out of the way, but well worth finding.        Booked the table, went there it was closed. The notice    This restaurant was absolutely fantastic. The staff were so welcoming and provided great service.

Food is there to make the wines even more enjoyable! Try some British cheeses and meats with your choice of wine or go along with the wine matches on our main menu. Nice pub on a couple of levels. In hindsight we didn't visit at the best time, on Christmas Eve for what essentially is a City pub, and in a pandemic there was never going to be a lot of people in there, so that detracted from the experience. The service was great though and the Chef even fessed up that the soup wasn't the best and didn't want to serve it to us, so fair play. The food we had was lovely, although possibly a little overpriced. The venue is apparently mostly taken over to block bookings, which I could see working nicely for a live music or DJ performance. Would recommend if you are in the area and fancied a bite, or live within easy reach and could make a music night.          How can you send this YOU CLOSD THE KITCHEND AND WE DID NOT EAT............NOT A MEAL AT ALL....JUST A PACKET OF CRISPS............................ WAS ANGRY CROSS AND DISAPPOINTED WE HAD CONFIRMATION EKMAILS EVEN ON THE DAY......NOW A POST VISIT EMAIL TO ASK WHAT WE THOUGHT WHAT A JOKE.......................      A particularly strange experience at a restaurant at this level. Booking for 6 was made effectively on the OpenTable app - as normal. We arrived on time, were seated, ordered drinks and - visited the loo where necessary (!) Then, we were asked to leave by our waiter as ""we have just accepted a large Corporate booking and we need to set up the room"" We asked to speak to the manager, who appeared to have a strange relationship with customer service expectations. He claimed ""you can't just book on OpenTable and then turn up here expecting a table"". But you confirmed our reservation 24 hours ago we responded. ""I didn't confirm it with you so it doesn't count"" We did try to point out how the Open Table app works but he was confrontational and stressed presumably due to the impending event. Subsequently the team relented, changed their mind and allowed us to eat (!) while they set up for Atkins - their important Christmas guests! Clearly if we could have found a replacement restaurant for 6 at short notice we would have taken this option but that was not realistic. Lessons learned - avoid the restaurant (particularly the difficult manager!) but if you do need to book don't use Open Table as they don't check the reservation system and always get the manager to confirm everything personally - as he doesn't trust his staff! :-) All very unsettling particularly considering the issues in the hospitality sector...     I Took my girlfriend for her birthday, her favourite wine is the Balfour Liberty. St Bart pub had sold out and do not expect to get anymore before April. This isnt a problem however being that a lot of people go their especially for that wine I wish they had sent an email out just to inform. Could have been handled much more professionally. Also, Awful music!      We came up to London for an exhibition and a concert in the evening, we booked a table at the Balfour as it was close to the concert venue, not knowing what to expect, what a wonderful surprise we had, we were greeted as if we were old long-standing customers. The restaurant was not busy at the time but soon became a place of vibrancy, we had a table on the balcony overlooking the main area and people watched those below, while we ate. We came to the conclusion that we were by far the eldest people there, it was so nice to see so many people enjoying themselves. The food and wine was fantastic some of the best lamb we have ever eaten, the wine came from a vineyard close to where we live, but we did not know it existed, English wine at its best. We cannot give enough praise to the staff they were kind and attentive and polite "

Explained I had a table booked but they were preoccupied with an impending arrival of a large group. Sat us right at the back, around the corner where it was dark, cold and dingy and stuck next to some temporary storage area. We asked to move to the next bigger table and they said yes, someone else then came round and said no, not it should have bothered anyone as their main group/guests/priority was in the main part of the restaurant. Service was pretty quick, the two new waiting staff were pleasant and attentive. Food was good, good flavour, subtle spice and kick where needed. Spring rolls, green curry and pad Thai shouldn’t be wrong but some are, not here, it’s rather nice, shame the service part of it was off otherwise the score would have been more.

Good food and service. 2-3 bottles of beer per person and the bill was £47.40 per head for poppadoms, starter and main, which was considered a little bit expensive.      First impressions on entry is that the decor is rather basic but dont be put off by that. I went two nights running and choose off the specials menu.      Nice place, and fairly standard food for an Indian restaurant, and service was OK although I think the waiter struggled to understand what was said. £48 for a simple 1 course lunch and no booze was quite pricey, although these days the location drives the price up I think. Given the place was deserted when we visited, I suspect the price has put people off. I managed to spill my lunch on my shirt, and it would have been nice for the waiter to hand a cloth, or tissues or similar, but no dice on that front. Shirt suit and tie ruined - but that wasn't the restaurant's faul - it was my fault, (there was a carrot-display on top of my dish which was cooked and carved in to the shape of a flower - so I thought I could cut it up and eat it - as it was raw, I couldn't and it shot off my knife like a rocket on to my shirt, tie, jacket). 3 stars is a pretty generous review, and actually looking at what I've written, this really could be 2 stars. I would recommend this place if nowhere else is available, but failing that I'd urge the management to either reduce pricing or look more closely at table-staff.                   Soothing ambient, amazing staff and, most importantly, very good food.

This Indian restaurant offers northern Indian cuisine in a sleek, spotlit setting. A cool architectural sculpture separates the bar from the dining room and the place is decorated throughout with tiger-themed art. Bengal Tiger differentiates itself from the curry houses that dot the City by its selection of chef’s specials. Food is freshly cooked to order and is prepared with fine ingredients that have been sourced from all over the world. If you’re looking for authentic Indian cuisine in a smart, relaxed City setting, then look no further than the Bengal Tiger. The sikandari raan is a magnificent version of slow-cooked spiced lamb shank. Chicken jaipuri in a medium tamarind sauce, and a tandoori-cooked duck akberi masala are equally memorable to the taste. We booked this restaurant only to find it was closed when we arrived. If you're going to provide a booking service you need to be 100% sure the restaurant is actually open. If my party had of been larger it would have been embarrassing. Not good!!     We arrived to our dining reservation and the restaurant was closed and in darkness. We had had no contact from them at all to say they would be closed. Abismal.      Very nice restaurant, clean and well laid out, attentive staff and very helpful      Great food, great service, a little expensive but I guess it is London. Would I go back? Yes I would.     We had a table of 20 for a business dinner -made to feel welcome - great service for the whole night - great food - everyone left with nothing but high praise for the place. Highly recommend !  "

Here, Roberto decides to take a step forward and introduces Bluefin tuna from Sicily to the equation and, it is extremely important to understand that this choice wasn’t made by hazard: the tuna is the only animal from the sea that has warm blood, like our Fassona cow. Moreover, and in general terms, both types of meat can be culinarily treated in a very similar way. This way our menu is a “mirror” of itself: you can enjoy a beef tartare or a tuna tartare, a beef steak or a tuna steak. For us, are now the same! And as in the first one, every product offered in our restaurant is the fruit of a meticulous work of artisans and farmers loyal to traditions, with whom we share the “Italian passion”.  Our beef and tuna tell the story of the people behind them and their passions, come and try it for yourself!Service was poor despite place being almost completely empty. Slow to take order then repeatedly forgot drinks order. Seemed unable to provide advice on either food or wine menu.  Food itself was ok but very expensive. Not good value.  Place had the feel of neglect.          Food was delicious, intact the best steak my friend had ever had. Unusual service with the waiter stabbing the knife into the table       Service was really bad     The place is very nice, we had the place to ourselves over a late lunch. The menu includes a good variety of choice and we had a nice meal. Our only concern was the price, it was high compared to similar places.     We absolutely loved our visit to Marcellaio. The service and food was outstanding and want to spend every birthday at Macellaio now!   "
